Where am I at right now with my ASA Parser tool?

2017 mar 23rd
  loading, sorting, screen and file out are working.
  three next things are adding Network Object Groups, Service Objects, and GUI
  I wish I had the first three working two weeks ago.

  I can in myself a reluctance to put a lot of code inside a if branch. my code habits are to make a function/method and call that from inside the block. there may be a performance trade-off with readability.
  
2017 mar 04th
writing to a file was the most important function for me to get working. I still want to bring in ACL's, Service Objects, etc. I still want to have a working compare function. I still want to have a working search function. I still want to make a working GUI. I want to complete some certifications more than all of this other stuff, so shifting back to the back burner for the moment, until I need a distraction.

file write
  writelines is working. I can bring in a file, and it will write to my specified file all of the network objects. I need to verify this will all work going through the menu.
GUI
  TKinter is based on TCL, which means not the same as Python. I see that getters and setters are used in tcl, but discouraged in python. just means i will have to pay attention.

file write (writelines method)
  had a change of heart on writing to the file.
  instead of having a class method as well as function in the main module, both operations will happen in the main module
  writelines will take in a list, and write the list to the file.
  each network object, service object, acl object, etc. will have a method to put each line into a list to prep for writing to the file
  
GUI
  had a talk with Shayne. the best learning experience will be to deploy a gui using both a class and as a library of functions. on reflection, the gui will be a group of tasks. a class is data and functions. 

Time
  i wish i had been taking more time to document how much time i am spending on this python program, the challenges, and how I am overcoming the challenges.
  
Vars  
  I need also to go through and look for variables that can be removed or brought down to more local namespaces. and make them more consistent.
