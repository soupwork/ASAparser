what am i trying to solve, what am I trying to do.
I really like the Cisco ASA's. 
however, some features I would appreciate include
  being able to display all of the network objects in order of name, IP Address, 
  being able to search through the config and find where a network object is used
  a hierarchial display of how a network object works its way down through acls and interfaces
  
I also like python, and this exercise gives me a lot of practice in Classes, file operations, etc.
    it should give me practice in checking preconditions (like are two configs loaded for compare, is the file avail for writing?)
    In the future, it should be a way to try out a GUI using tkinter.

How could I automatically ennumerate the ASA objects. I will need at least one. two, if I am going to compare two. Maybe up to four should be available. Seems like a waste to put them into a four-element list. It may be the easiest, most obvious way to store the objects. It would be easy to check if an object exists if it was an element in a list. If I query the length of the ASAlist, that value will be the next unused slot. I can append/insert into that position.
