what am i trying to solve, what am I trying to do.
I really like the Cisco ASA's. 
however, some features I would appreciate include
  being able to display all of the network objects in order of name, IP Address, 
  being able to search through the config and find where a network object is used
  a hierarchial display of how a network object works its way down through acls and interfaces
  
I also like python, and this exercise gives me a lot of practice in Classes, file operations, etc.
    it should give me practice in checking preconditions (like are two configs loaded for compare, is the file avail for writing?)
    In the future, it should be a way to try out a GUI using tkinter.

How could I automatically ennumerate the ASA objects. I will need at least one. two, if I am going to compare two. Maybe up to four should be available. Seems like a waste to put them into a four-element list. It may be the easiest, most obvious way to store the objects. It would be easy to check if an object exists if it was an element in a list. If I query the length of the ASAlist, that value will be the next unused slot. I can append/insert into that position.

i'm no ascii artist, but it may be the easiest way to show the relationship.

            load asaobject network objects from text file into a list
            sort asaobject network objects into a new list
            
Network Objects could probably be stored in a dictionary or tuple. Tuples are immutable, dictionaries are mutable. Sorting would be easier for both tuples and dictionaries. Indexing would be possible on dictionaries, but not with tuples. I am using a class because i'm not sure about methods for sorting and interrelationships on other objects, so i'm leaving it as a class.             

For outputting to a file, if I call the function to output to a file for a single object, i'll call the ASA object method. If i need to call the output to file function when comparing two ASA objects, I'll have to do that from the main program.
