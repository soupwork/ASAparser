# ASAparser
python program to sort through network objects
With the new Firepower Threat Defense, and using Firepower Management Center, I don't think this will work anymore.
To be honest, it wasn't working superfantastically before. 
However, I don't want to put a ton of effort into something that will be obsolete in short order.
It is functioning at the moment. After I have some FTD ASA's to work with, I may redo this and do a better job implementing.
For the moment, it is useful in a way that offsets the pain and unreliability of doing it manually.
