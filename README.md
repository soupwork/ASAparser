# ASAparser
This needs to be rewritten. Call it a learning moment.
Originally, this was a python program to sort through network objects
A better way would have been to use regex.
A *much* better way is to use an api to just query the information I want.


With the new Firepower Threat Defense, and using Firepower Management Center, I don't think this will work anymore.
To be honest, it wasn't working superfantastically before. 
However, I don't want to put a ton of effort into something that will be obsolete in short order.
It is functioning at the moment. After I have some FTD ASA's to work with, I may redo this and do a better job implementing.
For the moment, it is useful in a way that offsets the pain and unreliability of doing it manually.
